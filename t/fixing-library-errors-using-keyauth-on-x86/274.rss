    <title>Fixing Library errors/using KeyAuth on x86</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/fixing-library-errors-using-keyauth-on-x86/274</link>
    <description>I have seen a lot of threads talking about Library errors, eg: 
https://community.keyauth.win/t/library-x64-c1047/273
https://community.keyauth.win/t/library-x64-error/156

This is a well known &quot;issue&quot; (?), the Library KeyAuth uses is PUBLIC and can be found here: https://github.com/KeyAuth/keyauth-cpp-library

To fix the VS error C1047 all you got to do is recompile the Library yourself with the same settings as the project you are using it for.

Now if you want to use the Library for x86 projects theres a tutorial here:
https://github.com/KeyAuth/keyauth-cpp-library#different-architectures

As theres some people not knowing that and asking about it here I had to make a thread real quick, as always have a nice day.</description>
