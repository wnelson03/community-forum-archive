    <title>Download with webclient</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/download-with-webclient/633</link>
    <description>How do i make a webclient/download file button? I mean if you start your application it would install a dll (example) then execute it or whatever. But after you close it, it deletes automatically the file.
How can you do that? I know it doesent fit in this website, well technically it does but nvm. I hope you can help me</description>
