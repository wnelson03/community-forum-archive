Hello, I have made a program that uses KeyAuth for authentication. However I have a back end where my program will do most of the work (server sided). Is it possible to validate the session on the front end and send it to backend saying &quot;Hey Im Legit!&quot; This is to prevent people from Jacking my API and using my service for free. Thoughts?</description>

            <p>I found a different way. Is there a way to call the session ID?<br>
Only problem with sending to backend from keyauth’s servers it server load, as many people will be using my program and I do not want to shut down servers because of that.</p>
<p>How I have set it up is it currently authenticates with Keyauth and uses the session ID checks if its validated and if it is, It will allow the user to use my backend. <em>How will i print the session id?</em></p>

            <p>You can use the webhook function to send request to your backend from KeyAuth’s servers.</p>
<p>Look at this line in example <a href="https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example/blob/5496f8748ab7cab3aee5af129776d82d8bc73ed9/main.py#L115" class="inline-onebox">KeyAuth-Python-Example/main.py at 5496f8748ab7cab3aee5af129776d82d8bc73ed9 · KeyAuth/KeyAuth-Python-Example · GitHub</a></p>

            <p>My idea would be to put the respected KeyAuth SDK on the back-end, then use any form of communication from your front-end to your back-end to send the login details to (including hwid and ip) (preferably encrypted).<br>
from there, on the back-end, us the data to validate the user on every request</p>
<p><img src="https://community.keyauth.win/uploads/default/original/1X/59bf7cb965733e0d6c47c156436a37523f95e1b0.png" alt="Screenshot 2022-08-27 195807" data-base62-sha1="cNWKLzJC01CPYCQGCyhGSCrI7Ly" width="418" height="375"></p>
<p>when requesting to the server the next time, pass HWID, IP and session ID to validate the user is who they say they are.</p>
<p>Obviously I haven’t explained everything in perfect detail but maybe this provides a decent idea on where to get started.</p>
