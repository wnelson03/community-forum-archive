    <title>User var can be called even I deleted them</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/user-var-can-be-called-even-i-deleted-them/812</link>
    <description>so I make a user variable, let&#39;s say it&#39;s id1 = &quot;test&quot;
I tested it with make it a text in my app, I called it and it worked.
I then deleted the id1 user variable in the KeyAuth website and restart my app, but the text is still in there

```
            label2.Text = LoginSc.KeyAuthApp.getvar(&quot;id1&quot;);
```

I tried to relog the KeyAuth website just in case and check whether it actually gets deleted or not, and yes it&#39;s got deleted, there is nothing in user variables, but it&#39;s still the same, the label2.Text still has the user variable data that I&#39;ve already deleted

is this a bug from KeyAuth or is this my fault?</description>

            <p>fixed<br>
I guess it’s kind of bug, I deleted the user, make a new one with different username, and it works fine</p>
