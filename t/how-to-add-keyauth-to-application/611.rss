    <title>How to add KeyAuth to application</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/how-to-add-keyauth-to-application/611</link>
    <description>How do i add KeyAuth to my Application? Like how do i bind them? My goal is to start the KeyAuth first with a nice imgui/form and after you logged in with the key my application shows up. But after the trial you cant access the Application anymore. Is this possible? And yes i watched all tutorials on youtube and so on, i just dont know how to do it like order and what to include in the code. Because i created my code in the past. So my Question is, how can i do that? Am i creating an Folder named KeyAuth then putting all files in the folder then starting and then it works like i imagined? Sry for asking i am a beginner. I hope you can help me!</description>

            <p>Use the github example and learn it then add it to your code or add your code to it, you will need to know how to code in cpp to do this.</p>
<p>Also you have a topic open in the c# section and say you are new to coding and learning but now you are using cpp.</p>
