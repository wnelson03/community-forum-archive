            <p>You can use if statements</p>
<p>Very simple example.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">foreach (var subs in keyauthapp.user_data.subscriptions)
{
  if(subs.subscription == "testsub")
{
// rest of code if have sub with name tests
}else if (subs.subscription == "testsub2")
{
 // do something else
}

}
</code></pre>
<p>This is written very quick while on phone at work lol</p>
