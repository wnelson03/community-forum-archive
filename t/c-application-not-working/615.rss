    <title>C++ application not working</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/c-application-not-working/615</link>
    <description>I havent used keyauth for a few months and now my application wont work. I am using RunPe btw. 
I am able to login but when i try to load the program it just crashes.

Normally my program is executed then the loader closes which is why i have the exit code. Does this have something to do with a new keyauth update or anything?</description>
