    <title>KeyAuth c++ on mac or android</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/keyauth-c-on-mac-or-android/78</link>
    <description>Hello! 
I&#39;m trying to use default KeyAuth c++ code, but I can&#39;t do that from mac because it needs Windows.h. My program will be for mobile, so it&#39;s very big problem if it can&#39;t work with any other platform except windows.</description>

            <p>You can technically DM me but I won’t respond. Updating the current KeyAuth examples is enough work, I have no interest adding another example for a platform far less used than Windows.</p>
<p>If you can’t figure it out yourself, you could pay someone. Cystemz#1337 on Discord may be interested. We’ve verified him as a merchant, meaning he’s reputable.</p>
<p>Here’s his post in the <span class="hashtag">#offers</span> channel of our Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/keyauth" class="inline-onebox">KeyAuth</a></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Title: General Programming and Software Security (Backend development, Discord bot development, Checkers, pretty much everything)

Programming Languages: C#, C++, Golang, and Javascript

Estimated Time: The time depends on the project and what I have going on at the time, I'll always try to give an accurate time frame if asked.

Typical Price: Also heavily depends, usually $100 to $300 but can be lower if its a simple project.

I can do pretty much anything anyone would want as long as it won't take months on end as at the moment I cannot commit to something like that.

<p>If he’s not interested, you could look for someone on <a href="http://freelancer.com">freelancer.com</a> or a similar site to hire programmers.</p>

            <p>You may be able to remove certain parts of the C++ library code to make it work on other platforms. Not sure, I have a feeling cURL would work on other platforms.</p>
<p>Also, the documentation for non-encrypted API version is here <a href="https://docs.keyauth.win/api/" class="inline-onebox">Initialization - KeyAuth</a></p>

            <p>just make your own simple SDK that doesn’t involve the windows API.<br>
Unfortunately we don’t have a version prepared for Mac users</p>
