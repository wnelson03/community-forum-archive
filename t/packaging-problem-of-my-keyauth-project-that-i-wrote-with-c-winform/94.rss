Packaging problem of my keyauth project that I wrote with C# winform?


I want to use vmprotect, but when I pack, the C# software I wrote with keyauth does not open. I tried not to encrypt the api file. Again, there must be a solution for this.</description>

            <p>You need to set VMP settings to ignore the JSON attributes used in KeyAuth.cs, such as <code>success</code>, <code>message</code>, etc. These cannot be renamed by an obfuscator renamer or it breaks the program.</p>
<p>The default VMP settings work fine for me, so it’s a configuration problem with your VMP instance. Just play around with it and you should get it working.</p>
