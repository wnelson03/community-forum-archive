    <title>Best way to go about combatting people bypassing auth through changing auth api</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/best-way-to-go-about-combatting-people-bypassing-auth-through-changing-auth-api/221</link>
    <description>So recently I released an application that fought off reversers pretty well for as long as it did last. Unfortunately someone very skilled at reversing managed to change the api my tool was sending requests to. How can I prevent something like this happening in the future with Keyauth?</description>

            <p>Ah you’re c#. The link I sent above is c++. c# is inherently easier for attackers to deobfuscate given the fact it leaves behind far more metadata than c++</p>

            <p>I pay for a per file obfuscation and have limited details on what is actually in the obfuscation and protection included with it, it’s enough to stop low to mid level reversers but when you have a entire forum trying to reverse it it’s sort of hard to prevent <img src="https://community.keyauth.win/images/emoji/twitter/pensive.png?v=12" title=":pensive:" class="emoji" alt=":pensive:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

            <p>Enable hash checks on keyauth and if the obfuscator you’re using has anti tamper use it aswell</p>
