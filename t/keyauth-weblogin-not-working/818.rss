    <title>KeyAuth WebLogin not working</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/keyauth-weblogin-not-working/818</link>
    <description>:white_check_mark: I agree that **I will not ask for help with non-KeyAuth related topics**, this community site **is only for asking about the default KeyAuth example with NO changes made to it**



Look, basically I want to make a web loader, I followed the tutorial but it just gets stuck at the &quot;Waiting for user to login&quot;. I have tried everything such as removing my custom api domain and a few other stuff. Also me and mazk tried and his weblogin is working fine but mine is not. Are there any possible reasons as to why my web login does not work?</description>
