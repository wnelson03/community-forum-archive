    <title>X86 Error when logging in, works fine with x64 though</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/x86-error-when-logging-in-works-fine-with-x64-though/282</link>
    <description>So I decided to use my x64 loader as my base for my x86 project and I added the other libs to make it all work correctly it runs fine but whenever I try to log in it gives me an error that doesn&#39;t happen on x64.

There isn&#39;t any obvious reason on why it&#39;s doing this as it was working fine but as soon as I changed the architecture it just no longer let me log in, Thanks for any help.
