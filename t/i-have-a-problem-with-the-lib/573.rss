            <p>I realized the quality after posting too, <a class="mention" href="https://community.keyauth.cc/u/curve">@Curve</a> noone told him to uninstall/reinstall VS I told him to repair his VS which fixes corrupted depencies.</p>

            <p>Has to be the funniest comment I’ve seen yet from any support member<br>
Bunch of incoherences in your post, let me name a few</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why… Just why point out that bro debugged and accidentally leaked his program details? Is the FBI going to chase him for an ownerID he can refresh in “one button” ? (yes, literally one click on your dashboard.) <strong>NO</strong> so im not toxic and stuff but absolutely <strong>NOBODY</strong> cares</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And as that clearly wasn’t enough, youre pointing him to the wrong direction. Reinstalling visual studio will never change a C++ issue, where the fuck did you get this information from??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“This does not have to be library related, tho it might be” Okay just say it is and get straight to the point what the actual fuck??</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t hate you btw I like all support members but low quality post<br>
Anyways, nice info on other post this one was sad to see stil</p>

            <p>Good job leaking your program details, lol.</p>
<p>This does not have to be library related, tho it might be… is this the default GitHub example? <a href="https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CPP-Example: KeyAuth CPP Example</a></p>
<p>Try repairing your visual studio if the issue keeps happening.</p>
