    <title>Customer panel buttons not showing</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/customer-panel-buttons-not-showing/616</link>
    <description>So basically i fixed my previous thread and got the entire thing working flawlessly

Well. Actually its not running that &quot;flawlessly&quot; and has some flaws including when like I login and stuff it shows me my userid on my app and like it works and all you know but uhm the only problem is that it wont show the buttons i made and YES i have seller plan

So the buttons I made wont show up, Tried firefox chrome brave microsoft edge whatever browser mozilla released on earth even tried open sourced browsers and none of them showed up the buttons (and dont insult me ive tried 3/4 non-chromium based + and chromium based and didnt work)

I refreshed the page around 120 times (not capping) and STILL wont work!!

Please help,
TY my G</description>
