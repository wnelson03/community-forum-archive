    <title>Read before posting in C#</title>
    <link>https://community.keyauth.cc/t/read-before-posting-in-c/15</link>
    <description>The C# example is here https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CS-Example

Please look at the videos on YouTube too https://youtube.com/KeyAuth
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

We will only assist with the default example that hasn&#39;t been changed, or added to your code.

So, **do not** make a post if you&#39;re having issues adding KeyAuth to your code, only make an issue if KeyAuth is causing problems by myself.

For other circumstances, you should use https://google.com or https://stackoverflow.com, or try adding your code to KeyAuth example instead of the other way around.</description>
